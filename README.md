# CodeAlpha_AgeCalculator



As a part of my INTERNSHIP with CODEALPHA, I have completed my Task 2 of Age Calculator using html, css and JavaScript.

Here I Created a web-based Age Calculator using JavaScript to calculate users age based on their submitted date of birth.

JavaScript's built-in date and time functions simplify the age calculation process, making it easy to determine someone's age.
